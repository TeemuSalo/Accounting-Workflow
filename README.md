# Accounting-Workflow
A browser based monthly workflow scheduler mainly for accounting businesses.

The finnish business law dictates many different monthly dates and events when companies must report certain figures
eg. monthly VAT or amount of salaries payed.

This workflow scheduler is designed specificly for accounting businesses that have many small or medium sized
clients. Overseeing many clients reporting dates cant be cumbersome, and this browser based PHP and MySQL application
makes that a lot easier.

The application requires some sort of a server that can run PHP and have access to a modifiable MySQL database.

It does not yet self-install the database, and it requires a very specific database to operate, mainly certain types
of field names and values it can hold. As of now there has been no reason to add a self-installation.

This version of the application has been stripped of everything that relates to privacy of the clients if maintains,
the database, passwords and such.

I will add instruction to creating the required database if I deem it necessary.
